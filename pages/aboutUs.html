    <div class="info">
  <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum is an officially recognised 
     charity with the goal of preserving and encouraging people to learn the Slovak language and culture. While our main aim is supporting 
     Slovak speaking families and children, anyone is welcome should they be interested in learning the Slovak language and traditions.<br><br>
     Our mission at Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum goes above just teaching the Slovak language, instead we aim to inform people of our heritage, 
     and ensure that children with Slovak roots don't become out of touch with their own culture.</p>

       <h2>Our Journey</h2>
       <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester was founded by a group of dedicated teachers who shared a common vision—to establish a Slovak educational and cultural 
          centre that truly makes a difference.<br>
          With a passion for teaching, culture, and community-building, we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access quality education and cultural activities.<br><br>
          After months of hard work, we were proud to become a registered charity on 9th September 2024, marking a significant step in our journey. Our official launch on 15th 
          September was a proud moment, celebrated in collaboration with the Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela and the Association of Slovak Schools and Community Centres in the UK.
          Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting Slovak-speaking families, students, and individuals who wish to learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture together.</P><br><br>
          
          <h2>What We Offer and How We Help</h2><br>
       <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we provide Slovak language education, organise cultural events, and support Slovak-speaking families in navigating life between the UK 
          and Slovakia. Whether you're here to learn, stay connected to your roots, or find support, we are here for you.</p>
