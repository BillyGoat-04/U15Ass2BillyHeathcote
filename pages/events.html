       and community come together for a fun and welcoming afternoon. This hands-on event will offer something for everyone—families, individuals, and anyone who enjoys 
       arts, crafts, and festive traditions. Join us in decorating eggs using traditional Slovak techniques, creating beautiful Easter crafts, and learning about the 
       unique customs that make Slovak Easter so special. But this event is more than just a workshop—it's also a social gathering where you can meet new people, enjoy 
       great company, and experience a warm community atmosphere. Whether you're coming with friends, family, or on your own, you’ll find a friendly, relaxed environment 
       where connections happen naturally over delicious Slovak food and drinks. To make the afternoon even more special, we will have music playing throughout the event 
       and, if all goes to plan, we hope to welcome a special guest. Come along, get creative, and celebrate Slovak Easter traditions in a fun and social setting! More
